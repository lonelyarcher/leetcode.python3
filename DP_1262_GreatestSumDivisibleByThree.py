""" Given an array nums of integers, we need to find the maximum possible sum of elements of the array such that it is divisible by three.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,5,1,8]
Output: 18
Explanation: Pick numbers 3, 6, 1 and 8 their sum is 18 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Since 4 is not divisible by 3, do not pick any number.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: Pick numbers 1, 3, 4 and 4 their sum is 12 (maximum sum divisible by 3).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 4 * 10^4
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4 """
